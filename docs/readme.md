# StarCraft 2 Bot Learnings
Here I will describe my learnings as I build an automated player of the PC game StarCraft 2 (aka Sc2).

I look at the technologies required to interface with the game and some of the building blocks and later, simple robotics concepts.

This is not a tutorial on how exactly to call the Starcraft 2 API to achieve a quick win but rather a guide on the technologies and concepts required to build this bot.

Note, these docs are not yet complete.
